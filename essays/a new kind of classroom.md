Before this semester I had never even heard of a language called Typescript, but now in ICS 314 we are expected to learn. To get started, we were assigned tutorials to become familiar with this language. The Javascript one did not intimidate me as I have worked with it before in highschool. In fact, it was the first language I learned. On the other hand, Typescript made me nervous. It was something I’d never encountered.  

## Learning Typescript

After completing the Typescript tutorial, I felt like I had learned so much. It was fascinating to see that while doing these tutorials, I also received a much needed refresher on Javascript, which I realized that I haven’t worked with in almost 2 years. I was very nervous getting into this new language since it seemed like I’d be doing this by myself without much guidance. But I noticed that there are many parallels between Typescript and other languages I have used more recently, so TS does not feel completely foreign to me. In my experience, I think that once you learn one coding language very well, learning other languages becomes much easier to get used to. 

## Athletic Learning

While adjusting to this unfamiliar style of learning, I’ve also encountered the concept of ‘athletic software engineering.’ The meaning of this ‘athletic’ approach to learning is practice. We develop our skills by spending intentional time outside of class to practice what we do in class. One thing we will be doing in class is WODs (Workout of the Day), which acts as a sort of quiz that tests what we can accomplish in a set amount of time. One of my biggest stress factors is having to face unknown things and these WODs definitely qualify as an unknown. But working through the practice WODs that are available on the class website has helped me significantly. Working outside the classroom, through this style of athletic learning, has aided me in getting used to the idea of taking an in-class WOD and made me feel more comfortable. 

All in all, even though this class started off feeling a bit overwhelming, I’m beginning to find my footing. Typescript isn’t as daunting to face anymore, and the athletic approach to learning has helped me build some confidence. I still have a lot to learn, but I’m starting to feel more comfortable with the idea of tackling new challenges, one step at a time.
