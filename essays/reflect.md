## Introduction
In the beginning of the semester in ICS 314, I thought software engineering was mostly about building websites. But I quickly realized it’s really about learning how to build software that works well, is maintainable, and makes sense to other people. Two things that really stuck with me were coding standards and user interface frameworks. Both have lessons that go beyond just web development.

## Coding Standards
Coding standards are the agreed-upon rules for writing and organizing code. In our class, we used ESLint in VSCode to enforce these standards, which flagged issues ranging from missing spaces to unnecessary blank lines. At first, this felt nitpicky and restrictive. Minor errors seemed insignificant, and the red squiggly lines sometimes became overwhelming.

However, I quickly realized the benefits of following coding standards. They ensure that code is consistent, readable, and maintainable, which is especially important when working in teams or on large projects. Automatic tools like npm run lint-fix simplified the process, saving time while keeping code clean. Beyond web development, these standards are essential in any software project because clean, readable code is universally easier to build off of and maintain.

## UI Frameworks
User interface frameworks such as Bootstrap, Semantic UI, and Tailwind CSS provide pre-built components that simplify the creation of interactive and responsive interfaces. Before frameworks, developers had to manually code every element with raw HTML and CSS, which was time-consuming and error-prone. Testing compatibility across devices and browsers added even more complexity, especially for larger projects.

UI frameworks solve these problems by offering ready-to-use elements and responsive layouts. In one of my projects, I recreated the home page of Rainbow Drive In using Bootstrap 5. The framework allowed me to efficiently organize the page into sections, style components consistently, and ensure the layout adapted to different screen sizes. While learning how to properly apply classes and avoid conflicts was challenging, the process ultimately improved my understanding of structured design.

## Conclusion
Through ICS 314, I learned that coding standards and UI frameworks are more than just tools, they promote collaboration, efficiency, and maintainability. Coding standards ensure that code is clear and consistent, benefitting both individual developers and teams, while UI frameworks provide reusable structures that streamline development and reduce errors. These concepts show that software engineering is about more than writing code. It is about creating systems and processes that allow developers to work smarter, not just harder. These lessons will be valuable in any software project, not just web applications.
