## The Problem
In universities it is common for students to feel stressed from heavy work loads. Socialization becomes a lower priority festering loneliness, especially for students that dorm. For many people animals can provide emotional support; however, pets are not allowed in the dorms. 

## The solution
The Manoa PetPal app will allow students to:
Learn about pop up pet events
Book appointments with local pet owners to spend time with their pets.
Review and rate experiences with pets
Filter by type of animal

Approach:

For this app we will create a way to organize and present available animals to spend time with. There are three roles: pet vendors, users and admin. The pet vendors can login to specify their choices of the day or otherwise modify their pet data and profile data. Users can login to establish their pet preferences, and obtain contact information of pet vendors. Admins can login to define users as having the vendor role and otherwise administer the system.

The Manoa PetPal app will provide a consolidated source directory of animals taken from animal shelters like the human society. In addition to organizing pets by vendor, a user can also organize the data by animal type (e.g. breed, species, etc.).

Users should be able to indicate preferences and/or pet types to exclude in their search, which will help the app to present more individualized choices.
For places with animals who have been adopted out or brought in, vendors should be able to login to provide this data.

Mockup Page:
Landing page
User home page
Vendor home pages
Admin home page
Add Vendor page
User profile page
Pets available right now page
Today’s top picks page

Use Cases:
The new user goes to the landing page, logs in, gets the home page, sets up a profile. (How do they learn how the system works?)
Admin goes to the landing page, logs in, gets the home page, and edits the site.
The user goes to the landing page, logs in, looks for pets to ‘rent’.
User is notified of daily animals that match their preferences

## Beyond the basics                                                      						

After implementing the basic functionality, here are ideas for more advanced features:
Notify students via email, twitter, SMS when their preferred pets or pet vendors are available.
Automated updating of available pets from vendors. For example, they agree to post their availability via twitter, and your application retrieves their twitter feed and uses that data to update their page.
Allow students to rate and review pets.
Provide a feed of tweets from vendors (some vendors might use Twitter to advertise the pets and locations.)
